# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.

Traceroute sends ICMP ECHO request packets by default in windows and UDP packets by default in Unix-Like operating systems. Traceroute uses TTL to find the routers in the path to destination. Every router decreases TTL by one and once it has reached to 0, the packet is dropped and ICPM time exceeded response packet is send (similarly, for UDP). This tells the requester the IP of the router which dropped the packet. Hence, the requester can keep on increasing TTL by one everytime to find all the routers in the path to destination.

## Give the source IP address that issued the traceroute command and the destination IP address.

Source IP - 192.168.0.100
Dest IP - 74.125.225.46
